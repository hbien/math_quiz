This was an initial learning project for me to learn Rust. It is a simple math quiz program which keeps track of progress and is more likely to quiz on questions previously answered incorrectly or which took a long time. This is just an early beginning and there are many more additional options which could be added. There are probably existing open-source projects that do similar things, maybe even in Rust. This was mostly a learning exercise.
